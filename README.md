<h1 align="center">Echo Music Canvas</h1>

Implementing a new way to get beautiful custom canvas background videos for the **Echo Music** app.

This repository acts as the central hub for mapping custom `.m3u8` or `.mp4` background visualizers to specific songs or albums within the Echo Music client.

## How to Add a New Canvas

If you find a custom vertical visualizer or music video clip and want it to display as a dynamic canvas background in Echo Music whenever a specific song plays, follow these steps:

### 1. Upload your Video File
Add your video file into either the `Song/` or `Album/` directories within this repository.
* **Format:** `.m3u8` or `.mp4`
* **Example:** `Song/dracula_visualizer.mp4`

### 2. Update `canvas.json`
Open the `canvas.json` file located in the root of the repository. Add a new item block mapping the exact song name and artist to your new video URL pointing to your deployed domain.

**Example entry:**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "song": "Song Title",
      "artist": "Artist Name",
      "url": "https://echo-music-canvas.pages.dev/Song/your_video.mp4"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Commit and Push
Once you have uploaded your video and updated `canvas.json`, commit your changes, push them to your repository fork, and submit a Pull Request.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When opening a **Pull Request**, please include the **original song/album link** (YouTube Music, Spotify, or similar) in the description. This helps verify metadata and ensure the canvas matches the correct track.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: added canvas for Song Title"
git push origin main
```

Once your PR is accepted and merged, it will deploy automatically to Cloudflare Pages.

## Technical Requirements and Guidelines

To ensure the integrity of `canvas.json` and prevent layout or loading issues, make sure your visualizer files meet the following guidelines:

* **Aspect Ratio:** `9:16` (Vertical Canvas is required for mobile playback).
* **Format:** `.mp4` or `.m3u8` files.
* **File Size:** Max **5MB** for faster buffering and low data usage.
* **Looping:** 3–30 seconds duration with a clean loop transition.

## Continuous Integration (CI) and Automated Merging

We run an automated validation and auto-merge workflow on every Pull Request. If a Pull Request meets all the required checks and security conditions, the repository will automatically approve and merge the PR into the `main` branch.

### Automated Merge Conditions

For a Pull Request to be merged automatically, it must pass the following checks:

1. **Security Filters (File Constraints):**
   * The Pull Request must **only** modify `canvas.json` and files within the `Song/` or `Album/` directories.
   * Any modifications to scripts, GitHub Action workflows, web pages, or stylesheets will disable auto-merge and require manual developer review.

2. **GitHub Username Ownership Prefix:**
   * Newly added canvas files must be prefixed with your GitHub username (e.g., `username-filename.mp4` or `username-filename.m3u8`).
   * This ownership prefix ensures filename uniqueness, prevents collisions between contributors, and validates upload ownership.
   * Grandfathered legacy files are exempt, but all new contributions must use this ownership prefix format.

3. **Maximum File Size Limit:**
   * All newly added files in a Pull Request must be **equal to or less than 5 MB** to ensure fast loading and prevent build issues on Cloudflare Pages.

4. **Formatting and Integrity:**
   * **JSON Syntax:** The `canvas.json` database must be correctly formatted JSON.
   * **Schema Integrity:** The `song`, `artist`, and `url` fields must be present and match the local directory structure.
   * **No Duplicates:** No two entries in `canvas.json` can map to the exact same song and artist combination.

You can run this validation locally prior to committing:
```bash
node scripts/validate_canvas.js
```
